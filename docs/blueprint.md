## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light desaturated blue (#A7C4BC) to give a professional, reliable feel, mirroring the technical precision of cloning.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F5F5F5) provides a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted green (#7B9E8C), analogous to the primary, highlights key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a consistent set of icons with a modern, minimalist style to match the technical nature of the app.
- Implement a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, replicating the flexibility of the source website.
- Employ subtle, unobtrusive animations to enhance user experience and provide feedback on interactions, while preserving the feel of the original.
